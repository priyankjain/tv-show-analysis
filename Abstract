TRP ratings are not a reliable measure to understand the popularity of a TV show as it takes into account the taste of a very small group of audience as compared to the entire group of audience who view the TV show. Here, I propose and demonstrate a social media analytics tool to measure the popularity of a TV show on Twitter. A number of dimensions are suggested along which analysis can take place. Examples include sentiment analysis, gender, age group, impressions: unique/repeated, users: unique/repeated and the type of device used.

Leveraging Big Data, Machine Learning and Social Media to complement the TRP system
